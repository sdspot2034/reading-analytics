## 1. Introduction: Motivation & Rationale  
> The average person reads about **770 books in a lifetime**.  
_Source: [Economic Times](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/12/22/how-many-books-will-you-read-before-you-die)_

<br>

> There are roughly **129 million** books in the world.  
_Source: [Google Survey](https://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html)_

<br>
Therefore, an average person would only get to experience:
<br> <br>

```math
Percentage\ of\ books = (770 * 100) / 129,864,880
```
```math
= 0.00059292396\ \%
```
<br> <br>
This frighteningly small fraction of books at my disposal to be consumed galvanized me into analysing my reading patterns.  
## 2. Objectives:
1. **Optimize book selection** to ensure choices align closely with personal interests and preferences.
2. **Enhance time management** by focusing on high-potential books and discontinuing unproductive reads at the right moment.
3. **Minimize the rate of incomplete reads** by ensuring each book delivers value and aligns with my reading goals and tastes.
